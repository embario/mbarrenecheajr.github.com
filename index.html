	<p style="font-size:bigger;">I am a Ph.D. researcher in computer science working at the intersection of software engineering, human-computer interaction, social computing, and crowdwork. I graduated from the University of Colorado Boulder with <a href="http://cs.colorado.edu/~kena">Ken Anderson</a> as my advisor.

	<p>I'm interested in all-things software: engineering, design, theory, processes, and politics. My research focus is on the human-centered aspects of architecting, building, analyzing, maintaining, and deploying software systems. <i>Impact</i> is the objective of my research. Some questions here:</p> 

	<ul style="padding-left:10px; list-style-type:none;">
		<li><b>People first:</b> Who are we building for? What are their roles and relationships? How do they use existing systems in their own environments?</li>
		<li><b>Design and Architecture:</b> What architectures support the work processes that exist already? How can it be extensible, accessible, and flexible to ever-changing demands and requirements?</li>
		<li><b>Tools and Techniques:</b> What tools and techniques structure workflows for system use, design, development, testing, deployment, and evolution? </li>
		<li><b>Disruption and Adoption:</b> What is <i>needed</i> in the environment? What interfaces must be designed for users to adopt new systems?</li>
	</ul>

	<p>My approach is to apply empirical methods to investigate the role of software in various application domains. I plan on continuing my study of software engineering by seeking computer science research opportunities in academic, government, and industrial settings.</p>
