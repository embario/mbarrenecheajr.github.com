	<p>I am a 3rd year Ph.D. student studying computer science with my advisor <a href="http://cs.colorado.edu/~kena">Ken Anderson</a> at the <a href="http://colorado.edu">University of Colorado Boulder. </a></p>

	<p>I'm interested in all-things software: software engineering, design, methodologies, politics, etc. My research focus is on the human-centered aspects of building, analyzing, maintaining and deploying software systems in the context of disaster preparedness, response, and recovery.</p>

	<p>Some questions here:</p>
	<ul style="padding-left:10px; list-style-type:none;">
		<li><b>Workflow and Methodology:</b> How do software designers and developers organize themselves when engineering systems for disaster response? </li><br/>
		<li><b>Tools and Techniques:</b> What tools are they using? What does the web stack look like? Are analysis techniques such as static analysis adopted?</li><br/>
		<li><b>Disruption and Adoption:</b> What interfaces must be designed for software engineers in crises to adopt these tools and methods to build more stable and reliable systems?</li>
	</ul>

	<p>My approach is to apply human-centered design techniques to developer tools and methods to increase productivity in designing, implementing, testing, and evolving these systems. I plan on continuing my study of software engineering by seeking computer science research opportunities in academic, government, and industrial settings.</p>
