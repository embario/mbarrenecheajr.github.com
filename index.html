	<p>I am a Ph.D. student studying computer science with my advisor <a href="http://cs.colorado.edu/~kena">Ken Anderson</a> at the <a href="http://colorado.edu">University of Colorado Boulder. </a></p>

	<p>I'm interested in all-things software: engineering, design, theory, processes, and politics. My research focus is on the socio-technical aspects of building, analyzing, maintaining and deploying software systems in the context of disaster preparedness, response, and recovery.</p>

	<p>Some questions here:</p>
	<ul style="padding-left:10px; list-style-type:none;">
		<li><b>Workflow and Methodology:</b> How do software developers build systems for humanitarian efforts in a distributed environment? How do members of the public use these systems?</li><br/>
		<li><b>Tools and Techniques:</b> What tools and techniques structure workflows for system use, design, development, testing, deployment, and evolution? </li><br/>
		<li><b>Disruption and Adoption:</b> What interfaces must be designed for members of the public, crisis analysts, and software engineers during disaster events to adopt software?</li>
	</ul>

	<p>My approach is to apply interpretive and human-centered design research methods to investigate the role of software in disaster events. I plan on continuing my study of software engineering by seeking computer science research opportunities in academic, government, and industrial settings.</p>
