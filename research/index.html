	<p> With the wake of pervasive information and communication technology (ICT) in the hands of the public citizenry, the production and dissemination of safety and time-critical information - in the past decade observed online in a critical mass - demonstrate how a large and collectively-intelligent force can impact the response and recovery efforts during a natural disaster event.</p>

  <p>Contrary to established notions about the role of the public in disasters, the work conducted and performed on-the-ground by disaster victims is a <b>resource</b>, not a liability. Members of the public coordinate with each other to pull victims out of the debris, drive the injured to shelters, perform impromptu rescue missions, provide supplies, and self-organize to perform these tasks efficiently. In the 2001 World Trade Center attacks, people were ferried away from the fringe zone by spontaneous and coordinated work by those who knew how to operate boating vessels. During the 2010 Haiti earthquake, people converged onto the disaster scene to help find missing people, establish shelters for temporary relief, and other important relief tasks. These behaviors aren't new; that we are now seeing them online in software development contexts for humanitarian efforts, however, has burgeoned a wave of large-scale participation not seen before.</p>

  <p>This unprecedented wave of digital volunteerism has demonstrated how the crowd can conduct and perform a diverse range of tasks that help solve problems during disaster events. A plethora of virtual organizations known as "volunteer-technical communities" (VTCs), such as <a href="http://www.ushahidi.com">Ushahidi</a>, <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>, and the <a href="http://digitalhumanitarians.com">Digital Humanitarian Network</a>, have mobilized this converging force to facilitate the flow of critical information in disaster events. They build software and use it to <a href="https://crowdmap.com/welcome">display important sites on a Ushahidi map</a>, or to <a href="http://tasks.hotosm.org/"> coordinate tasks for mapping specific regions in an affected area</a>, for example. In a software engineering research context, what we have seen with this digital volunteerism are parallels to the open-source software development world that is well-understood. However, we are left with more questions to answer, such as: how do people self-organize to build software for disaster response? What development practices are shared among them? What tools and techniques are being used in development workflows? Are they similar to open-source development workflows? It is with this online phenomena that we must understand how it mobilizes developers to build software that supports the public during disaster events.</p>

	<p>However, software in this domain, the way we build it, and the way we use it, are not ideal. Applications need to be developed properly or risk falling over from unexpected bugs; they need to be scalable or risk collapsing under convergence; they need to be designed for the user or risk churn; but most of all, their actual use in the context of disaster preparedness, response, and recovery needs to be well understood, or it risks not being used at all. In a decentralized work environment, VTCs fall victim to global software engineering issues, like regional, temporal, and cultural differences and collaboration issues in round-the-clock development. The fragmentation of skillsets also makes it hard to coordinate tasks.</p>

	<p>It is clear that both the underpinnings of software development via VTCs, as well as the techniques used to build software for widescale use, are challenges for software engineering research. Based on these challenges, my research objectives are:

  <ul>
    <li>To use a research-through-design approach to develop insights in engineering systems that mobilize digital volunteers in solving important societal problems during disaster.</li>
    <li>To construct knowledge in the dynamics of VTC organizations and their co-management of people and software.</li>
  </ul> 

  Based on the collected quantitative and qualitative data in these two veins, we can determine best practice engineering tools and techniques that increase productivity and efficiency in VTCs, as well as to bridge real-world disaster scenarios with these insights to make arguments for situated use of software. New observations and insights in both these areas can help realize best practices for large-scale, decentralized software development and use in disasters.</p>
