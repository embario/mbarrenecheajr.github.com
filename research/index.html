	<h4>My research examines the organization and coordination in building software for disaster relief.</h4>

	<p> With the wake of pervasive information and communication technology (ICT) in the hands of the public citizenry, the information interface between formal emergency management and the public is widening, enabling opportunities to build ICT for large-scale situational awareness of disaster-related information. Volunteer technology communities (VTCs), like Ushahidi and OpenStreetMap, mobilize volunteer technologists - developers, analysts, and designers from all over the world - to participate in humanitarian efforts that aid thousands of disaster victims.</p>

	<p>However, software in this domain, the way we build it, and the way we use it, are not ideal. Mobile and web apps need to be scalable or risk falling over from unexpected bugs; they need to be designed for the user or risk churn; but most of all, their actual use in the context of disaster preparedness, response, and recovery needs to be well understood, or it risks not being used at all. In a decentralized work environment, VTCs fall victim to global software engineering issues, like regional, temporal, and cultural differences and collaboration issues in round-the-clock development. The fragmentation of skillsets also makes it hard to coordinate tasks.</p>

	<p>My goal is twofold: first, to ethnographically examine the dynamics of VTC organizations, observing the toolsets that they use in order to get the job done; second, based on the collected data, to determine best practice engineering tools and techniques that increase productivity and efficiency, as well as to bridge real-world disaster scenarios with these insights to make arguments for situated use. New observations and insights can help realize best practices for how large-scale, decentralized software development in disasters can get done.</p>

	<h3>EmergencyPetMatcher</h3>

	<p>EmergencyPetMatcher (EPM) is a web application that fosters the reporting, matching, and verification of lost and found pets as a collaborative effort during and after disaster events. EPM allows end-users to follow other users and coordinate in matching pets with their owners. The pet matches that are proposed in the system can be voted "up" or "down", and when a threshold is triggered, EPM will send messages to both parties encouraging human intervention in determining the success of the match. </p>
