<h2>EmergencyPetMatcher</h2>
  <p>EmergencyPetMatcher (EPM) is a crowd-based web application that allows pet advocates and enthusiasts at large to report, match, and verify lost and found pets as a collaborative effort during and after disaster events. EPM allows end-users to follow other users and coordinate in matching pets with their owners. The pet matches that are proposed in the system can be voted "up" or "down", and when a threshold is triggered, EPM will send messages to both parties encouraging human intervention to determine the success of the match. The application is not yet deployed but will be soon and can be accessed <a href="http://www.emergencypetmatcher.com">here</a>.</p>

  <p>EPM was a research effort for almost two years involving designers, developers, and researchers in studying online behaviors of pet reunion during mass displacement events. My colleague Joanne White recently published her work at CSCW on her ethnographic work examining an online pet community of pet advocates who self-organized to reunite pets with their owners on a Facebook page following the 2012 Hurricane Sandy event. She discovered that these digital volunteers mobilized to create an improvised case management system of photo albums and conversation threads to perform cross-validation, reporting, and matching work, the results of which were instrumental in reuniting many pets with their owners.</p>

  <p>EPM largely is not meant to be compared along other social media like Facebook pages. Rather, we are interested in how it can further support online pet matching behaviors that we have observed from White's work. Two major research goals are behind EPM: first, to use human computation as an engineering technique to solve an important societal problem and how crowdwork patterns can be leveraged to support motivations for engaging in this problem. Second, to examine the role that EPM will serve in the greater technological landscape of software solutions in response to disaster events. Naturally, as adoption grows, we would like to understand the features that EPM provides (or does not provide) that encourages its use. Software engineering issues, including issues of scalability, reliability, and usability, are first-class concerns to sustain its use in the wild.
