	<p>Coordinated with friends, this seminar is structured for casual and critical discussion of all music. The goal is to enjoy conversing about pivotal artists, albums, and songs that have helped shape the diverse landscapes of music. The seminar will go into some music theory in order to appreciate the underlying artistic contribution, but it will also draw from a socio-cultural perspective to round out our understanding of the music being made. Any ideas on how to improve upon or alter the seminar is greatly appreciated!</p>

  <p>We have a curated google doc <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ghW2rT-36FlR9A_7_aElDMdLZ3dBOOdJka8CHMfls_4/edit">here</a>: . We are just beginning this group in the Boston area. If anyone is interested in joining, please email me!</p>
